						The term ‘aviation’ is most commonly used to describe mechanical air transportation, 
						which is carried out using an aircraft. 
						The two main aircraft types are airplanes and helicopters, but most modern definitions of the word ‘aviation’ 
						extend beyond this to include unmanned aircraft, such as drones.
						With this in mind, the aviation industry can be described as all industry that surrounds these activities

									and knowledge to safely and effectively operate aircraft. Essentially the job of a Pilot
									requires detail to precision and focus, like any other transporting job the lives of other people depend on the
									person controlling the vehicles or mode of transport in use. A quote by Leonardo Da Vinci "For once you have tasted
									flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward. For there you have and and there you will

									airspace and on the ground at airports. 
									Their primary goal is to ensure the safe and efficient flow of air traffic. 
									Air traffic controllers use radar, radio communication, 
									and other tools to provide instructions to pilots, such as altitude assignments, route changes, and sequencing for takeoffs and landings.
									Air traffic controllers work in control towers at airports, area control centers, and en-route centers. 
									They are trained to handle various types of aircraft, including commercial airplanes, private jets, helicopters, and military aircraft.
